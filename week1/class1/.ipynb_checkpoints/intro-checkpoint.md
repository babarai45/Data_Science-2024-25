## Week 1: Introduction to Data Science 

### What is Data Science?

- Data science is a set methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information. It is a field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.
- Data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and domain knowledge to analyze and interpret complex data.
- Data science is used to solve complex problems, make decisions, and predict future outcomes using data.
- Data science is used in various industries such as healthcare, finance, marketing, retail, and more.
- Data science is a rapidly growing field with high demand for skilled professionals.
- Data science is a combination of data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning.
- Data science is a key component of artificial intelligence and big data analytics.
- Data science is a field that requires a combination of technical skills, domain knowledge, and problem-solving abilities.
- Data science is a field that requires continuous learning and adaptation to new technologies and methodologies.
- Data science is a field that offers a wide range of career opportunities and growth potential.
- Data science is a field that requires collaboration and teamwork to solve complex problems and achieve common goals.
- Data science is a field that requires ethical considerations and responsible use of data to ensure privacy, security, and fairness.

## work flow of data science

### Data collection:
-  Collecting data from various sources such as databases, APIs, web scraping, sensors, and more.
### Data preprocessing: 
- Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
### Exploratory data analysis:
- Exploring and visualizing the data to gain insights and identify patterns.
- Feature engineering: Creating new features or variables from the existing data to improve the performance of machine learning models.
### EXperimental,Prediction ,Testing and Deployment of model:
- Building and evaluating machine learning models to make predictions or classify data.

# Data science are divided into 3 main categories
- Tridiational Machine Learning(ML)
- Deep Learning (Neural Networks)
- Internet of Things(IoT)

## Tridiational Machine Learning(ML)
- Traditional machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to enable machines to improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed.
