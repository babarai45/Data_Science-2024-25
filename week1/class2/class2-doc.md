# INTRODUCTION TO DATA
- data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or just descriptions of things.

# How can Collect Data ?
  # we can collect data in 2 ways
    - Primary Data or first hand data or field research data or original data 
    - Secondary Data or seconad hand data or desk research data or existing data or published data
 #   - Primary Data: Data collected by the investigator himself for a specific purpose.  
          - Example: Surveys, Interviews, Questionnaires, Focus Groups, Observations, Tests, Experiments, Measurements, Logs, Records, Databases, Technology
-   Primary data is the data that is collected by the researcher first hand. This type of data is new and original, because the researcher collects it himself.
-   primary data is costly and time consuming to collect, but it is more accurate and reliable.
-   

#   - Secondary Data: Data that has been collected by someone else for a different purpose.
          - Example: Books, Journals, Magazines, Newspapers, Websites, Blogs, Social Media, Forums, Databases, Technology
          - Secondary data is the data that has already been collected by and readily available from other sources.
          - Secondary data is less expensive and less time consuming to collect than primary data, but it is less accurate and reliable.
          - Secondary data is also called second-hand data or desk research data.
### let's see some examples of primary and secondary data collection methods
# problem: i need data about the population of pakistan
# Primary data collection methods
  - lets i am babar i need data about the population of pakistan
  - i can collect data by myself by going to every house and asking the number of people living in that house that is called primary data

  - i can collect data from the internet or from the websites or from books,from newspaper  that is called secondary data
  - it is less expensive and less time consuming but it is less accurate and reliable data 


# After collction of data  to use Primary and Secondary Method we Categories Data into 2 Types
### -there are 2 fundamental types of data
  - Structured Data
  - Unstructured Data
#   - Structured Data: Data that is organized into a structured format, such as a table,liek tabular(row,colum) and with clear schema .
          - Example: Databases, Spreadsheets, Tables, CSV Files, XML Files, JSON Files
          - Structured data is easy to search, sort, filter, analyze, visualize,use, understand,interpts,work with,communiacte and present .
          - Structured data is also called quantitative data or numerical data.
          - Structured data is the most common type of data.
# let's see some examples of structured data
  - Example1```
    | Id |Name | Age |City |
    |----|-----|-----|-----|
    | 1  |Ali  | 25  |LHR  |
    | 2  |Ahmed| 30  |KHI  |
    | 3  |Sara | 22  |ISB  |
    | 4  |John | 35  |NYC  |
    | 5  |Emma | 28  |LON  | 
    ```
