#  observations or just descriptions of things.

# data types in statistics 
# Manily, there are two types of data in statistics
# 1. Qualitative data,or categorical data or attribute data or non-numeric data
# 2. Quantitative data, or numerical data or numeric data or continuous data

# Qualitative data: data that is not numerical 
# Qualitative data is further divided into two types
# 1. Nominal data: data that is named or labelled or categorized
# 2. Ordinal data: data that is ranked or ordered or categorized

# Quantitative data: data that is numerical
# Quantitative data is further divided into two types 
# 1. Discrete data: data that is countable or numerical
# 2. Continuous data: data that is measurable or numerical

# discrete data is further divided into two types
# 1. Primary data: data that is collected by the researcher
# 2. Secondary data: data that is collected by someone else

# Continuous data is further divided into two types
# 1. Raw data: data that has not been processed
# 2. Processed data: data that has been processed

# Quantitative data is further divided into two types
# 1. Interval data: data that is ordered and has equal intervals
# 2. Ratio data: data that has a true zero point

# categorical data is further divided into two types
# 1. Time series data: data that is collected over time
# 2. Cross-sectional data: data that is collected at one point in time

# Time series data is further divided into two types
# 1. Panel data: data that is collected from the same group over time
# 2. Longitudinal data: data that is collected from the same group over time

# Big data is further divided into two types
# 1. Big data: data that is large and complex
# 2. Small data: data that is small and simple

# Open data is further divided into two types
# 1. Open data: data that is freely available
# 2. Closed data: data that is not freely available

# numerical data is further divided into two types
# 1. Missing data: data that is not available
# 2. Available data: data that is available

# structured data and unstructured data


# structured data: data that is organized in a specific format or structure 
# unstructured data: data that is not organized in a specific format or structure

# structured data is further divided into two types
# 1. Text data: data that is in the form of text
# 2. Numeric data: data that is in the form of numbers

# unstructured data is further divided into two types

# 2. Audio data: data that is in the form of audio

# Image data is further divided into two types
# 1. Video data: data that is in the form of videos
# 2. Picture data: data that is in the form of pictures

# Audio data is further divided into two types
# 1. Speech data: data that is in the form of speech
# 2. Music data: data that is in the form of music

# Speech data is further divided into two types
# 1. Voice data: data that is in the form of voice
# 2. Sound data: data that is in the form of sound

# Music data is further divided into two types
# 1. Instrumental data: data that is in the form of instrumental music
# 2. Vocal data: data that is in the form of vocal music

# Instrumental data is further divided into two types
# 1. Classical data: data that is in the form of classical music
# 2. Non-classical data: data that is in the form of non-classical music



#  Data is the foundation of statistics.
#  Data is the raw material of statistics.
#  Data is the information that is collected, analyzed, and interpreted in statistics.
#  Data is the basis of statistical analysis. 
#  Data is the starting point of statistical research. 
#  Data is the key to statistical research. 
#  Data is the heart of statistical research.
#  Data is the soul of statistical research.
#  Data is the essence of statistical research.
#  Data is the core of statistical research.
#  Data is the lifeblood of statistical research.
