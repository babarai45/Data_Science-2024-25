# what is labeld and unlabeled data?

labeld data is the data that has been tagged with one or more labels. This is the data that is used to train a machine learning model. The labels are the correct answers that the model is trying to predict. For example, if you are trying to build a model that can predict whether an email is spam or not, you would use labeled data where each email is labeled as either spam or not spam.


unlabeled data is data that has not been tagged with any labels. This is the data that the model will be used to make predictions on. For example, if you have a model that can predict whether an email is spam or not, you would use unlabeled data to make predictions on new emails that have not been labeled yet.

# types of labeld data?

There are two main types of labeled data: binary and multiclass.

Binary labeled data is data where each example is labeled with one of two classes. For example, in the spam email example, each email is labeled as either spam or not spam.

Multiclass labeled data is data where each example is labeled with one of more than two classes. For example, if you are trying to build a model that can predict the genre of a movie, each movie might be labeled with one of several genres, such as action, comedy, drama, etc.

# type of unlabeled data?

There are two main types of unlabeled data: structured and unstructured.

Structured unlabeled data is data that is organized in a consistent format, such as a table or a list. For example, a list of customer names and addresses would be considered structured unlabeled data.

Unstructured unlabeled data is data that is not organized in a consistent format, such as text or images. For example, a collection of emails or a set of images would be considered unstructured unlabeled data.

# what is feature and target and what is the difference between them and its types?

In machine learning, the terms "feature" and "target" are used to refer to the input and output variables of a model, respectively.

# Features
 are the input variables that are used to make predictions. For example, if you are trying to build a model that can predict the price of a house based on its size and location, the size and location would be the features and price would be the target.

# Targets
 are the output variables that the model is trying to predict. For example, in the house price prediction example, the price of the house would be the target.


There are two main types of features: numerical and categorical.

# Numerical features 
are features that represent quantities, such as age, weight, or price. These features can take on a range of values and are typically represented as numbers.
set of values and are typically represented as strings or integers such as col

# Categorical features are
 features that represent categories, such as color or genre. These features can take on a limited number of values and are typically represented as strings or integers.

There are two main types of targets: regression and classification.

# Regression targets 
are continuous variables that represent quantities, such as price or temperature. The goal of a regression model is to predict the exact value of the target.

# Classification targets 
are discrete variables that represent categories, such as spam or not spam. The goal of a classification model is to predict the class of the target.



# more types of features ?
nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.

# Nominal features
 are features that represent categories with no inherent order, such as color or genre. These features can take on a limited number of values and are typically represented as strings or integers.

# Ordinal features
    are features that represent categories with an inherent order, such as size or rating. These features can take on a limited number of values and are typically represented as strings or integers.

# Interval features
    are features that represent quantities with a consistent scale but no true zero point, such as temperature or time. These features can take on a range of values and are typically represented as numbers.

# Ratio features

are features that represent quantities with a consistent scale and a true zero point, such as weight or height. These features can take on a range of values and are typically represented as numbers.
