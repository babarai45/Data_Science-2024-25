                DATA SCIENCE 
-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------

Data Science is a field that uses scientific methods,
processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge 
and insights from structured and unstructured data. 
Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistics,
 data analysis, machine learning, 
 domain knowledge and programming to analyze and interpret complex data.

                MACHINE LEARNING
-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses 
on the development of computer programs that can access data 
and use it to learn for themselves. The primary aim is to allow 
the computers learn automatically without human intervention or 
assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

                Problem Definition
-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------

Problem Definition is the first step in the Data Science and Machine Learning process.
It involves defining the problem that needs to be solved and understanding the
requirements and constraints of the problem. The problem definition should be clear,
specific and measurable.

Examples of Problem Definition:
1. Predicting the price of a house based on its features.
2. Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
3. Identifying fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset.
4. Recommending movies to users based on their preferences.
5. Predicting the likelihood of a customer churning.

                Data Collection
-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------

Data Collection is the process of gathering data from various sources
such as databases, APIs, web scraping, sensors, etc. The data collected
should be relevant to the problem being solved and should be of high quality.

Types of Data Collection:
1. Structured Data: Data that is organized in a tabular format with rows and columns.
2. Unstructured Data: Data that does not have a predefined structure and is not organized.

Sources of Data Collection:
1. Databases: SQL databases, NoSQL databases, etc.
2. APIs: Application Programming Interfaces that provide access to data.
3. Web Scraping: Extracting data from websites.
4. Sensors: IoT devices that collect data from the physical world.
5. Surveys: Collecting data through questionnaires and surveys.

                Data Preprocessing
-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------

Data Preprocessing is the process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing
the data for analysis. It involves handling missing values, encoding categorical
variables, scaling numerical variables, and splitting the data into training and
testing sets.

Steps in Data Preprocessing:
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the data.
2. Data Transformation: Encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical variables.
3. Data Reduction: Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
